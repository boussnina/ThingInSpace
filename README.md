# Thing in Space 🚀

A small reflex-based browser game built with React, where you have to close portals before *The Thing* (a loose nod to Dr. Adams) blasts you.

## 🎮 What it is

Portals open faster and faster, and your job is to click and close them before *The Thing* charges up and fires. It’s a test of reaction time and focus — made as a warm-up tool before jumping into video games.

## 💡 Why I made it

I wanted a fun and quick game to sharpen my reflexes — something fast-paced and slightly chaotic to get in the zone before real gaming sessions.

## 🛠️ Tech stack

- React (with Vite)
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
- useEffect, setTimeout, and basic state management

---

Play it, warm up, and don’t let *The Thing* wack you.
